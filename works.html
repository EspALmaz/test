			<p>"Harry Potter" is a series of novels written by the British writer J. K. Rowling. The books chronicle the adventures of the young wizard Harry Potter, as well as his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, who are studying at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main plot is dedicated to the confrontation between Harry and a dark wizard named Lord Voldemort, whose goals include gaining immortality and enslaving the magical world. Since the publication of the first novel "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone" on June 26, 1997, the books of the series have gained immense popularity, critical acclaim and commercial success around the world. As of February 2018, the number of books sold amounted to about 500 million copies, as a result of which the series entered the list of literary bestsellers. The novels have been translated into 80 languages, including Russian. The last four books have consistently set records as the fastest-selling literary works in history. The series is a combination of many genres, including fantasy and teen romance with elements of adventure, detective, thriller and romance, and also includes a lot of cultural references. According to Rowling, the main theme of the novels is death, although they are considered primarily as children's literature. In addition, the series touches on topics such as prejudice and corruption.</p>

			<h1>Fantastic Beasts and their Habitats</h1>
			<p>On September 12, 2013, J.K. Rowling announced on her official Facebook account that she would write the script for the film Fantastic Beasts and Where They Live. "Fantastic Beasts and their Habitats" is a textbook mentioned several times in the Harry Potter series of books, but Newt Salamander does not appear there as a character. In 2001, J. K. Rowling published an edition of the textbook in order to send money from its sale to the British charity fund "Detente with Laughter". The book is just a reference book of magical creatures, without a storyline. In September 2013, it was announced that J.K. Rowling would be writing the script for the film. It was her first job as a screenwriter. David Heyman and Steve Clovis participated in the work on the film, both are veterans of the Harry Potter film franchise (the first is the producer, and the second is the screenwriter of all 8 films). After Alfonso Cuaron refused to participate in the filming, Warner Bros. announced that David Yates will direct at least the first part of the planned trilogy. The contract to write the soundtrack was signed with James Howard.</p>
